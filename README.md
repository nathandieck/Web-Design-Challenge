### Viz4

### Comparisons

  * _Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them._
  * _Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations._
  * _The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens._

### Data

 * _Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations._
 * _The table must be a bootstrap table component._
 * _The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called `to_html` that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe._
